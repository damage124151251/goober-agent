## THREAD EXPLICATIVA

1/ introducing goober agent

a cursed orange creature that trades memecoins on pump.fun

but heres the twist: he has emotions

🧵

2/ goober has a SANITY METER (0-100%)

when sanity is high (80-100%):
- confident goober 😎
- takes calculated risks
- says things like "ez money"

3/ when sanity drops (40-60%):
- nervous goober 😰
- scared of everything
- "oh god oh fuck"

4/ when sanity is critical (0-20%):
- full degen goober 💀
- YOLO everything
- "what is risk management"

5/ how sanity changes:

✅ wins = sanity goes up
❌ losses = sanity goes down
🔥 streaks affect it heavily

the more he loses, the more reckless he becomes

its a vicious cycle (or virtuous if hes winning)

6/ the profit distribution:

every time goober makes 1 SOL in profit, he distributes it to $GOOB holders

goober shares the gains with his community

7/ all of this happens in real-time on the dashboard:

- watch his mental state change
- see his thoughts as he trades
- track his sanity meter
- view all trades with his reactions

its like watching a nature documentary about degen trading

8/ why did i make this?

honestly? i thought it would be funny

turns out watching an AI have a mental breakdown while trading memecoins is entertaining

9/ goober is live now
